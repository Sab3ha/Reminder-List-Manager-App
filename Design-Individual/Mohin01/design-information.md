1\. I create a reminder list class which will have implementations of
letting users add reminders form a list, delete reminders from a list,
and edit reminders in a list.

2\. A database class is created which will store any relavent data.

3\. To add reminders to a list by picking them from a hierarchical list,
where the first level is the reminder type, and the second level is the
name of the actual reminder, I created in my reminder list class a
checkAll method will realizes its level of hierarchy.

4\. To specify a reminder by typing its name, the type would be stored
along with the name.

5\. The reminders are automatically and immediately saved after they are
modified.

6\. The user is able to check off reminders in the list.

7\. The user is able to check off a reminder list.

8\. The check off data would be stored in the database.

9\. The application would present the reminders grouped by type.

10\. In the reminder list class the user is able to select, edit and
update, and remove a reminder list.

11\. The reminders are set up with a date and time alert which also has
an option for repeated alarms.
